Welcome to **Kindergarten**!  
Dear Parents and Students,  Welcome to a brand new school year in Kindergarten! We are so excited to begin this journey together. This year will be filled with wonderful learning, new challenges, and many opportunities to grow. Our goals are to help each child develop a love for learning, strengthen their skills, and build confidence as they explore the world around them.  We are ready to receive our students with joy, patience, and care, creating a safe and happy environment where every child feels valued. Together, we will make this a year full of discovery, growth, and memorable experiences.  With love and enthusiasm, Ms. Astudillo.
