Welcome to **Kindergarten**!  
Dear Students and Families,  Welcome to Kindergarten A! I am super glad to welcome you to our school! I am your kindergarten teacher, and I am looking forward to working with you this year.  *My Dream for Our Class*  My dream for our class is to create a happy and safe place where everyone can learn and grow. I want you to feel comfortable asking questions, sharing your ideas, and making mistakes. I believe that everyone learns from their mistakes, and I am here to support you.  My goals for the year are:  - To help you learn and understand new things, such as: alphabet, numbers, shapes, Science, etc. - To make learning fun and interesting, through: games, music and dance. - To help you become confident and independent learners, by: encouraging self-directed learning, providing choices - To build a strong and supportive class community, where everyone feels valued and respected  *About Me*  My name is Yhuliana Varona, and I am excited to get to know you and your family. I have been teaching for 10 years, and I love helping students learn and grow. In my free time, I enjoy reading or listening to music. I am looking forward to learning more about you and your interests too!  *Let's Work Together*  I believe that we can achieve great things together. I am committed to supporting you and helping you reach your full potential. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via email or during parent-teacher meetings. I am always here to listen and help.  Thank you for being part of our school community. I am excited to start this new year together!  Best regards, Yhuliana Varona S. Kindergartenâ€™s teacher
