Welcome to **First A**!  
Dear Students & Families,   Welcome to a magical new adventure—First Grade A style! I am so excited to meet each and every one of you. This year will be full of learning, laughter, and lots of love as we grow together—both in our minds and in our hearts.  In our classroom, we will discover new things, solve tricky problems, and celebrate our victories—big and small.  I promise to bring magic into our learning and joy into our journey, so buckle up—because First Grade A is going to be an unforgettable ride! Let’s learn, grow, play, and sparkle together!   Warmly, Ms. Dorado
