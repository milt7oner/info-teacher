Welcome to **Frogs A**!  
I'm excited to welcome you to this new school year. This is a very special moment for me, and I look forward to getting to know each of you and starting this new year together.

I want that you feel comfortable and safe, and I'm committed to creat a warm and stimulating environment where children can learn, grow, and develop in a holistic way. I'm here to support and help you in everything you need.

My goal is to work with you to make a success school year and see our children reach their full potential. I'm excited to share special moments together. Ms. Ortega de Frogs' House
