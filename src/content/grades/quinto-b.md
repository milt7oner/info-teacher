Welcome to **Fifth B**!  
Dear Students and Families,  Welcome to 5th grade! I am so excited to begin this school year with you. This year will be full of learning, growth, and wonderful experiences, and I canâ€™t wait to share the journey with each of you.  One of my biggest dreams for this school year is to create a classroom where everyone feels safe, valued, and motivated to do their best. My goal is not only to help students improve their English and academic skills, but also to guide them in becoming curious learners, kind friends, and confident young people. I believe that learning should be fun, interactive, and connected to the world around us in social and environmental endeavors. A little about me: I have a deep love for nature, forests, and conservation. I believe that caring for the environment is one of the most important things we can do, and I enjoy sharing this passion with my students through stories, class discussions, and creative projects that connect our learning to the world around us. Outside of school, I love spending time outdoors, reading, listening to music, and discovering new ways to live in harmony with nature.
