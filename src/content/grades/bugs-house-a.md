Welcome to **Bugs House A**!  
Dear Students and Families,

Welcome to Bugs' House A!
 I am very happy to be your teacher. I am excited to learn and grow together with you. I love helping students learn new things and feel proud of their hard work. I enjoy reading, writing, and learning about different topics.

This year, I want to help every student feel safe, happy, and ready to learn. We will work hard, try our best, and help each other.  I want our classroom to be a kind and respectful place for everyone.

Thank you for being part of our classroom community.
 I look forward to a great year together!

With warm wishes,

Ms. Vidal
Bugs' House A Teacher
