Welcome to **First B**!  
Welcome to this beautiful journey we will be doing together. My name is Carla Dreher and I’m going to be your teacher this year. I’ve been working with kids for about 10 years and I’m happy to tell you that I really enjoy it. I studied art and design so my classes would be filled with lots of colorful exercises. Please feel free to rely on me as a teacher but also as a person. I’d would make me feel very proud if every single one of you grows as a student and as a person.
