Welcome to **Coding Club**!  
I'm excited to be your instructor this year. As a Telematics Engineer with a passion for technology and education, I believe coding is one of the most powerful tools we can learn to shape the future.

Whether you're just starting out or already experimenting with code, this club is designed to spark your creativity and help you grow.

Outside of the classroom, I enjoy sports, traveling, and diving into video games — especially the ones that challenge your logic and strategy.

I love seeing how tech connects with everyday life, and I hope to share that enthusiasm with you. Together, we'll explore programming languages like Python and JavaScript, build cool projects, and learn how to think like real developers.
