Welcome to **First C**!  
Welcome Letter  Dear families and students,  My name is Vanessa Sarria, and I am very excited to welcome you to this new school year. I am sure it will be a fun year, full of meaningful learning, challenges, and moments that will help us grow together.  I am a kind teacher, always willing to listen and respond to my studentsâ€™ needs. I truly believe that every child has great potential, and my goal is to guide them to discover and develop it in a respectful, joyful, and motivating environment.  My dreams and goals for this year focus not only on strengthening academic knowledge but also on nurturing values, creativity, and self-confidence. I am fully committed to working hand in hand with you, the families, because I know that together we can achieve great things.  Welcome to this exciting journey of learning!  With care, Ms. Sarria
